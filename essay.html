    <h1>Essay: The Role of National Internet Resources and Infrastructure in Innovation and Development</h1>

    <p>As Vietnam enters a new phase of development, the need for breakthrough strategies in science, technology, innovation, and digital transformation becomes more urgent than ever. The Resolution No. 57-NQ/TW of the Politburo aims for Vietnam to become a modern industrialized middle-income country by 2030, and a developed high-income country by 2045. To realize this vision, national Internet resources and infrastructure—such as the ".vn" domain, IP/ASN addresses, DNS systems, and VNIX exchange points—play a crucial role. They are not only the technical foundation but also a driving force to comprehensively accelerate innovation and digital transformation.</p>

    <p>Internet resources are strategic assets. Managing and developing the national domain ".vn" affirms Vietnam's digital sovereignty and its presence in cyberspace. IP/ASN addressing ensures the country's networks are globally identifiable, enabling fast, stable, and secure Internet connectivity for digital production, commerce, and services. The national DNS system and VNIX points are pillars for rapid access, low latency, and support for deploying large-scale digital services such as cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence.</p>

    <p>As emphasized by General Secretary and President To Lam, digital transformation is "a key driver for advancing productivity, reforming production, and ushering the nation into a new era." Similarly, the Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh stated that digital transformation has "reached every alley, every home, every citizen." To truly become a national growth engine, Internet infrastructure must be effectively managed, rapidly expanded, and creatively applied in all sectors.</p>

    <p>A creative idea would be to build a shared Internet resource platform tailored for startups and small enterprises. This platform could offer low-cost subscription-based services such as subdomains under ".vn", virtual IP addresses, DNS management, and integrated cloud computing. It could also incorporate AI tools for security monitoring and performance optimization. Such a model would reduce startup costs, foster grassroots innovation, and democratize access to national Internet infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Internet resources and national infrastructure are not merely technical platforms—they are runways for breakthrough ideas to take flight. Building ultra-broadband networks, nationwide 5G coverage, and mastering strategic digital technologies are essential. Yet, it is the effective, innovative, and synchronized use of these assets that will propel Vietnam toward its goals for 2030 and 2045: becoming a prosperous, modern, and globally competitive nation.</p>
